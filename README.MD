# What is this?

This is my dotfiles. Obviously.

# How do i use this?

You clone it and then run `./setup.sh` within the directory. This will ask you a series of questions regarding whether you are on Ubuntu or Fedora (for now). Once done, it will auto move and stow everything to the correct folders.

# Does the setup.sh work?

Not sure. But it should.
